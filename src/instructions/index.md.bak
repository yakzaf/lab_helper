# Measurement of Reflectance and Transmittance

## Measurement Procedure

The purpose of the experiment is to measure the reflectance and transmittance of different samples. This is done with the aid of an illuminance meter, a reflectometer, a transmittance meter, standard of reflectance made by Ocean Optics and a black body (tube with black coated interior). For the experiment we have to analyse the reflectance using two different methods:

(i) Comparison between reflectance of standard and reflectance of the sample   
To do this it is necessary to adjust the arm position of the integrating sphere by rotating it and ensuring that the light source is located at the bottom position. In this position we measure the illuminance of 10 different samples and of the black body by placing them on top of the photovoltaic cell. The black body measurement is used to reduce systematic error. Lastly, using this method we have to measure the illuminance of 5 known manufacturer samples and compare the measured results to the ones provided by the manufacturers. On the basis of the illuminance measurements, we have to calculate the reflectance’s of the samples under test using the relation stated below.

$$
\rho_x = \rho\frac{E_x-E_0}{E_s-E_0}
$$
$$
E_0 = 1.3\ lx,\ 
E_s = 37.8\ lx,\ 
\rho_s = 98\%
$$

(ii) Taylor’s method
The procedure is almost similar to that described in the 1st method, but the difference is the arm position of the integrating sphere and no use of the standard of reflectance. In this method the arm points upwards ensuring that the light source is located at the top position. For the 10 unknown samples and 5 samples with manufacturer information we have to measure the illuminances and on the basis of the measurements compute reflectance’s using the relation below. 

$$
\rho_x = \frac{E_{bottom}-E_0}{E_{top}},
$$
where $E_{bottom}$ is from the 1st method

The measurement of transmittance is done using a transmittance meter. For this procedure we have to measure the illuminance when no sample is placed between the photometer head and the luminaire and the illuminance when the sample is in-between the two. These measurements are repeated for 8 different samples and for 4 random combinations of the samples. We also have to use two different luminaires to determine their impact on transmittance and for our case we used an LED bulb and a standard incandescent bulb. On the basis of the illuminance measurements, we have to calculate the transmittance using the relation below.

$$
\tau_x = \frac{E_s}{E_0}
$$
$$
E_{0LED} = 1910\ lx.\ E_{0inc} = 620\ lx
$$
